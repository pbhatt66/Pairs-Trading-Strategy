### Details

This project backtests a pairs trading strategy from 2014-2024. Bollinger bands are used for entry/exit signals. 
Pairs are selected from a trial period of 2011-2014, where the pairs that performed best in this time period and satisfied the correlation, cointegraion, and ADF tests are selected for the backtesting period.
Goal is to have a market neutral strategy that reduces risk for investors.
